# Netflix UI Clone

This project is a clone of the Netflix website created for practice. It focuses on replicating the UI design and adding custom features to gain a deeper understanding of how streaming websites like Netflix are structured and function.

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to clone the Netflix homepage layout and design, giving special attention to its interactive features such as the video carousels, hover effects, and navigation menus. The project is aimed at frontend practice to better understand how streaming platforms are built.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For creating the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: For styling the elements and making the UI look similar to Netflix.
- **Flexbox and Grid**: Used for creating responsive layouts.

## Steps I Followed
1. **Website Analysis**: 
   - I examined Netflix's homepage to understand its layout, the arrangement of elements like banners, carousels, and menus, as well as its interactive features.
2. **HTML Structure**: 
   - I structured the webpage into key sections such as the header, movie carousels, and footer.
3. **CSS Styling**: 
   - I replicated Netflix's color scheme, typography, and layout using CSS, applying Flexbox and Grid for responsive layouts.

## Features Added
- **Responsive Layout**: The webpage adjusts according to screen size, offering a desktop, tablet, and mobile-friendly view.
- **Movie Carousels**: Interactive carousels for movie and TV show displays that users can scroll through.
- **Hover Effects**: Movie posters display additional information or actions (e.g., "Play" or "Info") when hovered over.
- **Nav Menu**: A sticky navigation bar that shows when the user scrolls up and hides when scrolling down.
